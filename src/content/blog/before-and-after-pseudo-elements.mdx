excerpt: "The before and after pseudo elements in CSS are used to insert 
content before and after an element's content. We can resource to them instead of 
adding more html code to get to the results we need. 
In this post we're going to go deeper into these pseudo-elements and apply 
them in different applications."

The **before** and **after** pseudo-elements are used to add content before and after an HTML element's content. Let's suppose we have a **h2** element and we want to add a decorative bar before it. We're going to add and style this decorative bar using the before pseudo-element:

```html
<h2>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
</h2>
```

```CSS
h2::before {
	background: tomato;
	width: 40px;
	height: 40px;
}
```

Please, run these two pieces of code in any dev environment you feel comfortable working in. It could be a new Codepen. 

And nothing happens, OK?. Something is missing and without it, we can not render anything in that space. We need the **content** property inside the **h2** CSS selector, like so:

```css
h2::before {
	content: 'text';
	background: tomato;
	width: 40px;
	height: 40px;
}
```

If we inspect the heading element in Dev Tools, we can see that the `::before` pseudo-element is now present and the 'text' **content** value is placed before its content, like so:

<ArticleImage alt="The before pseudo-element appearing on the element inspection in Dev Tools" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1693256625/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-08-28_at_16.00.05.png"/>

Again, the before and after pseudo-elements allow us to add content before and after the **content** of an element.

Now, we can see the word "text" before the heading, with a "tomato" background color.  So the **content** property is essential when styling before and after pseudo-elements. We'll review the different values this property can take during the development of this post, but for now, you can see we can place a string value. Notice that the width and height are not applied to that string. 

What happens if we remove the "text" word and leave the content property as an empty string? Let's see: 

```css
h2::before {
	content: '';
	background: tomato;
	width: 40px;
	height: 40px;
}
```

Once again, nothing is rendered. There's another important key concept to learn for these pseudo-elements and it's the fact 
that they're positioned **"inline"** **by default**. So, for the first example with text, 
the content worked fine because there was text in it. But as with any empty element, 
it would only work if we convert the pseudo-element to a **block** element, like so: 


```css
h2::before {
	content: '';
	background: tomato;
	width: 40px;
	height: 40px;
	display: block;
}
```

We can finally see a tomato square, a 40 x 40 box rendered before the h2 heading, as the following image illustrates: 


<ArticleImage alt="A screenshot showing the result of applying a before psudo element to a h2 heading"

If we applied the **after pseudo-element** we would have the same square, but placed after the h2 heading: 

```css
h2::after {
  content: '';
  background: blueviolet;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  display: block;
}
```


<ArticleImage alt="A screenshot showing the result of applying an after psudo-element to a h2 heading"

Open the Dev Tools, and you'll see that the heading has not an after pseudo-element:

## Other values for the 'content' property

So far, we've just seen the basic use of the content property with before and after pseudo-elements. 
In this section, we're going to discover more about the utility we can give to it when implementing parts of UIs with CSS.

### Using an image as the content property

For a mainly decorative purpose, we can set the content property with an image. 
For example, the following snippet of CSS sets a paragraph element before a pseudo-element with an image: 

```css
p.image-before::before {
  content: url(//unsplash.it/100/100);
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

As an example, you may want to create a **p** element with a class of **.image-before** and apply the previous **CSS** code that uses a random image from the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) Website, but you can set it up with any image from your local drive or from any assets folder you're using in your codebase or framework.

In the previous example, you can also find it in this pen you may want to fork it. 


<Codepen pen="bGOEmgG" />

You can experiment with another image that is purely decorative with other dimensions that match your design. 

### Using an attribute value as the content property

Another way to set the content property value is to use an attribute from the element. 
A useful application is the creation of tooltips with pseudo-elements. 
The tooltip text can go in a **data-tooltip** attribute, for example, which then, can be extracted 
in the **content** property of a `::before` or `::after` pseudo-element, like so:

```html
<a class="tooltip" href="/" data-tooltip="This is a tooltip">A tooltip</a>
```

```css
a.tooltip {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  max-width: 150px;
}

a.tooltip:hover::after {
  content: attr(data-tooltip);
  position: absolute;
  top: -34px;
  right: 20px;
  padding: .5rem;
  background: hsl(220 20% 50%);
  color: white;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

This example shows a link with a class of "tooltip" and a `data-tooltip` attribute that contains the 
text "This is a tooltip".  On the `hover` state, we're using the `::after` 
pseudo-element, whose content property value is `attr(data-tooltip)`. 
Notice that the pseudo-element is placed after the `:hover` pseudo-class, and also notice that the tooltip has an `absolute` position, 
so we can adjust the presentation of the text over the link. 

In summary, use the `content: attr([attribute])` in order to use its value as a `::before` or `::after` pseudo-element's content. 

### Enumerating lists of items

Another great application of `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements is the creation of counters and enumeration of lists. I think it's better to explain with the following example: 

```html
<section class="enumeration">
    <h3 class="enum-subtitle">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. </h3>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio sequi vero molestias? Alias nobis cum tenetur vel dolor id sint, blanditiis natus unde eligendi autem tempore minus ut repudiandae perspiciatis?</p>
  
  <h3 class="enum-subtitle">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. </h3>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio sequi vero molestias? Alias nobis cum tenetur vel dolor id sint, blanditiis natus unde eligendi autem tempore minus ut repudiandae perspiciatis?</p>
  
  <h3 class="enum-subtitle">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. </h3>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Distinctio sequi vero molestias? Alias nobis cum tenetur vel dolor id sint, blanditiis natus unde eligendi autem tempore minus ut repudiandae perspiciatis?</p>

</section>
```

```css
.enumeration {
  counter-reset: counter-enum;
}

h3.enum-subtitle {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
  align-items: center;
}

h3.enum-subtitle::before {
  counter-increment: counter-enum;
  content: counter(counter-enum) ' ' ;
  display: block;
  background: hsl(270 40% 50%);
  padding: 0.5rem;
  color: white;
  border-radius:9999px;
  font-size: 1rem;
  width: 35px;
  height: 35px;
  min-width: 35px;
  white-space: no-wrap;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

I have created a `<section>` element inside which there's a list of `<h3>` headings, each followed by a paragraph. 
If we want to enumerate this list, we can use a **counter** that we define in the parent (section element). 
In the example, we name this counter "counter-enum", as a value of the property **counter-reset**. 

Then, inside the heading `::before` pseudo-element, we use another new property called **counter-increment**, 
which we have set to the value of the **counter-reset** property "counter-enum". The last part of this setting is the **content** property 
with a value of the **counter([name-of-counter])**; in our case it's `counter(counter-enum)` .  

The remaining CSS corresponds to how we position and style the number placed before each title. 
We have aligned it to the heading as a flex item, and the number itself is a rounded box converted into a flex container to align the number to the center. Of course, we have decorated it with background and text colors. 

What should happen if we create another section with the same class that includes another list of items? The counter resets and the enumeration starts all over again for the new list. Try to clone the  `.enumeration` section of the previous example and test that the new list items start from 1 again. 
But, if we just place the repeating block outside the `.enumeration`
section? It will keep the counting up, as long we use the class `.enum-subtitle` for the outer `<h3>` heading.

## A card component using before and after pseudo-elements

As a final example, let's create a card component that will be styled using `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. 
Where we may use an extra inner element in the card container, we will just use the pseudo elements, and inside them, 
we will write CSS code that will enhance the visual appearance of the card. 

Let's start by creating the HTML markup: 

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550133730-695473e544be?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1470&q=80" alt="a person posing in front of a round red door">
  <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur</h2>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Perspiciatis nemo</p>
</div>
```

The card has an image and text that could be assets relevant to the user. An initial CSS implementation follows:

```css
.card {
  position: relative;
  width: 60%;
  height: 60vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  margin-inline: auto;
  padding: 1rem;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```


We should have something like this; 


<ArticleImage src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1693428868/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-08-30_at_15.50.49.png" 
alt="Screenshot of a card component implementation with CSS"/>

Then, position the image absolutely to its parent element, the card itself: 

```css
img {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -3;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  inset: 0;
  object-fit: cover;
} 
```

We need to place it behind any additional content, and also because we will create a nice effect later on. Notice that we're not using the ordinary absolute positioning syntax: top: 0, left:0, bottom:0, right: 0. Instead, we're applying a recent syntax with the use of the [`inset:0` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset). 

As a wrap-up, let's create a screen or layer for the card and the image, using the `::before and ::after` pseudo-elements: 

```css

.card::before {
  content: "";
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  inset: 0;
  position: absolute;
  background: hsl(10 70% 50%);
  z-index: -1;
  display: block;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}

.card::after {
  content: "";
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  inset: 0;
  position: absolute;
  background: hsl(180 70% 50%);
  z-index: -2;
  display: block;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  mix-blend-mode: soft-light;
}
```


Here, we position the pseudo-elements one behind the other through the usage of the `z-index` property: -1 for `::before` and -2 for `::after`. 
Each pseudo-element has a different background we can use to apply a `mix-blend-mode` value that ultimately, creates the nice effect you can see. 


<ArticleImage src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1693431278/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-08-30_at_16.34.17.png" alt="result application of before and after pseudo elements in card" />

Of course, I changed the text color to `white` to have a better contrast in the parent `.card` element. 
The `mix-blend-mode` property is something that makes this implementation nicer and I encourage you to [learn more about it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode), and the different values it can take; just don't forget that the mixing occurs based on the background colors we have set up in the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements and the image itself. 

The finished version of this example you can find it in this Codepen:
