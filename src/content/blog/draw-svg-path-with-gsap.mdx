Using motion effects in User Interfaces helps to enhance their usability.
Lately, lots of tools, like [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/),
have been created in order to help designers and developers to create animations that make their interfaces more vivid and easier to use.
CSS also has native features such as transitions and keyframe animations that have been used by developers since long ago.
SVGs have brought up a great opportunity to create more realistic interactions, combining the power of vector
graphics and the capability of animation libraries to release them from their static nature and make them behave
as real objects, approaching more to the physical world users are used to. This, of course,
it's been also a solid step to more sophisticated user interfaces and enhanced usability.

One of the most exciting topics about SVG animations is implementing the effect of drawing a path around a
shape or object. In this post, we're going to learn about SVG strokes, and how to animate them,
leveraging the use of the best platform out there: [Green Sock](https://greensock.com/).

## Drawing a Path effect

Maybe you have already seen Websites or Applications that have elements or objects that have borders or
strokes that are drawn or painted on the screen, automatically. The purpose of this illusion or animation might be to **draw**
the user's attention to some action or help them to complete some task, or simply to impress or delight the user while they are
browsing a Web page.

For example, if you visit [this site](https://chungiyoo.com/), this kind of animation is present in some parts of the
home page such as the introduction banner, where a circle is drawn around the **"of"** word.
Further, in the "Some of my selected Works" section, there's another drawing ellipse around the **"works"** word.

The amazing [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/) has an immense portfolio of GSAP animations
on her [Codepen profile](https://codepen.io/sdras) you may wish to explore. There, you can find Draw animations
like [this one](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/YJzpNp) representing technical aspects of Serverless functions.
See how seamless and practical this animation serves to explain some difficult topics or key concepts.
In fact, another use you may want to give to these sorts of animations is to enhance infographics and illustrate topics more
attractively and boost interest in the user.

## Key SVG element stroke attributes

To demonstrate the "Draw a line" animation, I'm going to use a square as a basic example shape, like so:

```html
<svg
  width="738"
  height="376"
  viewBox="0 0 738 376"
  fill="none"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
>
  <rect
    x="3"
    y="3"
    width="732"
    height="370"
    fill="#32936F"
    stroke="#28333E"
    stroke-width="6"
    stroke-dasharray="12"
  />
</svg>
```

The presentational attributes regarding the border of the shape are the basic components for the effect we want to create.
`stroke` is used to set up a color to the border, `stroke-width` which corresponds to the width of that border and the `stroke-dasharray`
attribute sets up a dashed style. The following **Codepen** uses the SVG of the previous example, but it has a modification on
the `stroke-dasharray` attribute.

<Codepen pen="dyQQbYY" />

The first number (20) corresponds to the size of the dashes and the second one (10) to the gaps between them.
In general, the `stroke-dasharray` attribute allows us to set up a pattern of dashes and gaps for the stroke of the
shape. [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray#example) you can find more
examples of patterns.

Finally, there's one more attribute that is a key component for our animation goals. The `stroke-dashoffset`
attribute allows us to define an offset for the rendering of the **dash array** pattern.
Please, look at the [examples on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dashoffset#example)
on how to use this attribute. To summarize this attribute, we can push (a negative offset) or pull (a positive offset)
the start of the dash array with an empty space. This "movement" of the dash array elements is what will
allow us to create the stroke Drawing effect.

## Using GSAP for the animation

It's time for GSAP to enter the stage. In fact, we could animate the `stroke-dashoffset` attribute with just CSS,
but Green Sock is much better for [control, performance, and development experience](https://greensock.com/transitions/), so I think this is the right way to go.
Working with GSAP is delightful. It abstracts all the mechanisms we may look into for an animation platform: timeline,
easing functions, and plugins; and you can animate almost any element and attribute we can imagine.
For SVGs for example, we can animate [presentational attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/Presentation) (those that define a visual style for an element) such as `stroke`, `stroke-width`, `fill` , `fill-opacity`, `stroke-opacity` and so on.
But first things first. [There are different ways](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation) we
can install and start using Green Sock. The most straightforward one is to load it as a library in **Codepen**.
In fact, paid plugins can be used for testing purposes too, making it very convenient for us developers in order
to learn and practice.  
Whenever we want to start a new GSAP demo in Codepen, you must first load the library via its CDN.
You can search for it in the Codepen settings screen, like so:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Codepen settings to load GSAP library"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1690562362/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-07-28_at_11.32.35.png"
/>

Now that we have loaded GSAP in our Codepen, let's analyze how we can create a **Marching Ants** animation
around the square of the previous example:

```javascript
const tl = gsap.timeline();

tl.to("rect", {
  ease: "none",
  strokeDashoffset: -24,
  duration: 1,
});

GSDevTools.create({ animation: tl });
```

First, we create a **timeline** using `gsap.timeline()` function.
This timeline enables us to add the tweens or animations we need for different elements we have in our markup.
The `to()` method creates an animation addressed to the **rect** element inside the SVG, corresponding to
the rectangle shape. The object argument of the `to()` function defines the animation with some properties.
In our demo, pay close attention to the **strokeDashoffset** property. It corresponds to the presentation
attribute **stroke-dashoffset** in the **rect** shape we learned previously. Here, though, we use a **camel case**
nomenclature for such type of attributes whose name is dashed-separated.
If we were to animate the **stroke-dasharray** attribute, we have to define the animation with
the property **strokeDasharray**

We set the **strokeDashoffset** to a value of **-24**, pushing **24** user units to the rendering of
the **stroke-dasharray** dash pattern rendering, as we learned previously.
We remove any easing to this animation to make it seamless (for the effect we want to achieve),
using `ease: 'none'` and finally, we set the duration of the animation to one second `duration: 1`

The **GSDevTools** declares the use of the [GSAP DevTools plugin](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/GSDevTools)
you can load the same way as we loaded the GSAP library in Codepen, like so:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Screen shot that illustrates how to load GSAp DevTools plugin in Codepen"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1690563844/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-07-28_at_12.03.48.png"
/>

You can control the animation at certain points during its execution which will help us to understand and debug
our animations easily.

When we run the animation, we can see how the dashes are moving from left to right on an "ant march" sequence:

/>

# Drawing a line animation

The following pen shows another Draw path animation for a pentagon:

<Codepen pen="BaGREaZ" />

Take a look at the CSS section of the pen. The presentation attributes of the pentagon (defined by a path element in the SVG), are
now set up as CSS-style properties. Remember that if we don't define a `stroke` property, we won't be able to create stroke animations.
The Javascript code is a little more elaborate than the "marching ants" example. The main logic behind this animation is that we need
a dash whose size is the same as the length of the pentagon, and "to move" it (actually the drawing line animation), we need to offset that dash by the same length. To get the length of the path, we write this line:

```javascript
const strokeLength = Math.ceil(path.getTotalLength());
```

And we initialize the stroke like this:

```javascript
tl.set("#pentagon", {
  strokeDasharray: strokeLength,
  strokeDashoffset: strokeLength,
});
```

Then, we create a `to()` tween, which moves the offset to zero, and "painting" the line around the pentagon
during 2 seconds:

```javascript
tl.to("#pentagon", {
  strokeDashoffset: 0,
  duration: 2,
});
```

This tween is the same as the following, but using the `from()` one

```javascript
tl.from("#pentagon", {
  strokeDashoffset: strokeLength,
  duration: 2,
});
```

The next tween corresponds to "erasing the line". Again, we are "moving" the `stroke-dashoffset`
value to the left or right, pushing or pulling the stroke dash, which, remember, has the same size as the
length of the pentagon.

```javascript
.to("#pentagon", {
  strokeDashoffset: -strokeLength, //(+ to erase backwards)
  duration: 2,
},"+=1")
```

This all seems a little confusing. In fact, try to play with the stroke properties values,
and draw on paper the offsetting of the dashes to understand deeply how all this works.
In summary, don't forget that the two main properties to make this kind of animation are `stroke-dasharray`
and `stroke-dashoffset`. And don't forget to also review more about them in its
[documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray).

## Animating a stroke with the GSAP plugin DrawSVG

So far, we've learned how to animate strokes, manipulating the presentation property `stroke-dashoffset`.
It could be enough for simple animations, but sometimes you may want to have more control not only with the
dash offset but with the dash array. Some other calculations may be needed to achieve the effects we want
for our animations and complexity may arise. For those scenarios, it is better to use
the GSAP [DrawSVG plugin](https://greensock.com/drawsvg/), which allows you to create amazing drawing animations.

### The basics of DrawSVG

The following video is a thorough introduction to using the DrawSVG plugin:

<ArticleVideo video="6UAoyBcn2fk" />

As you may already have concluded, the key part of the use of this plugin is the property `drawSVG`,
in the animation object of a tween. This property can have two values as a string: the first corresponding
to the start of the stroke and the other to the end, meaning, how much, in percentages, the start and the end of
the stroke is drawn along the path. Controlling the start and the end of the stroke allows us to create awesome
path animations. The following pen is a demonstration of how to use different values to produce different effects
on drawing a stroke.

<Codepen pen="bNdLyR" />

## Draw from a perceived shape center animation with DrawSVG

Let's consider for this example the following Codepen:

<Codepen pen="vYQeRvb" />

First, note that the SVG is composed of two rectangle shapes, the first which works as the "unpainted" stroke and the other one
which would "paint" that stroke. We want to start our drawing animation from the bottom center of the shape and for this we
need to calculate it, using its perimeter. As you can see, the rectangles have a width of 300px and a height of 100px.
The origin of the shape is placed in the top left corner, so we should sum up the top of the rectangle's length (300px) + right side (100px) + half of the rectangle's bottom (150px), giving a total of 550px. This will be the start of the stroke as well as the end of the stroke. We animate from this point:

```javascript
tl.fromTo('#draw',{drawSVG: "550 550"},
...
```

The finish point of the animation, considering the same origin (top left corner of the rectangle)
is 951px (start of the stroke, going from the center to the left) and 150px (end of the stroke, going
from the center to the right). The following diagram further describes the settings for the animation.
The red and purple arrows show the direction of the start and end of the stroke from the center of the rectangle.

![Diagram showing a DrawSVG animation from a rectangle's perceived center](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1690822186/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230731114840.png)

The same principle of this animation can be applied to other more elaborated animations, but considering percentages.
The following pen is an example of how the curved line stroke extremes overpass its length (150%) to create a
different effect for the start and end of the stroke.

<Codepen pen="BaGdYrq" />
