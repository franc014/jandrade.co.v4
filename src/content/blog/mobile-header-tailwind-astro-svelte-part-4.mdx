This is the last post on the implementation of a Tailwind, Svelte, and Astro header for mobile. 
We'll focus on making the interactions more human-centric by using transitions, an important feature we need to add 
to any Web application, so users can perceive them more. 

In fact, until now, we can perceive the closing and showing actions of components that make up the App Header, as fast, 
rigid movements that seem somehow robotic. To make these interactions more vivid, we can use transitions, and fortunately, 
Svelte has an extensive related API ready to be used. Let's do it!

## Identifying the components where we need to apply the transitions


Remember that our application example is pretty small and all we need is to make the appearance/hiding of the navigation and the toggle buttons in the header, subtler. 
So, we need to apply transitions on the `<NavBtn />` component, that corresponds to the toggle buttons, and on the `<nav>` element that renders the menu items. 

## Applying the transitions

The following steps can be used to apply the transitions to the components we described previously: 

### 1. Wrap the component in a key block

[Key blocks](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/key-blocks) detect any change in a state variable (in our case a store variable related to the open/closed state of the navigation and the toggle buttons) and destroy and recreate their contents when the state changes. 

Let's do it first with the toggle buttons. Surround the `<button>`  element defined in the component `<NavBtn>` with a key block, like so:

```html
{#key $navIsOpen}
	<button on:click={toggleNavbar}>
		<slot />
	</button>
{/key}
```

Similarly, surround the `<nav>` element in the `<Menu />` component with another key block:

```html
{#key $navIsOpen}
	<nav
	class:navIsOpen={$navIsOpen}
	class="w-full hidden py-8"
>	
	<ul class="text-center text-2xl tracking-wider text-slate-200">
		<li><a href="/">About</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Products</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Reviews</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Contact</a></li>
	</ul>
	</nav>
{/key}
```

Whenever the `$navIsOpen` store variable changes, the transition will trigger inside the key block contents.

### 2. Apply the transition to the element or component

The second part is to just apply the transition. Svelte has directives designed for this and we can configure them depending on the motion we want the users to experiment.

We can use the `transition`, `in` and `out` directives for the different effects on different elements.

For example, for the menu buttons we can use the `scale` transition, like so:

```html
//NavBtn.svelte

<script>

import { navIsOpen } from "./stores";

import { scale } from "svelte/transition";

  

function toggleNavbar() {
	navIsOpen.update((open) => !open);
}
</script>

  

{#key $navIsOpen}
<button class="absolute right-2 -top-1" transition:scale on:click={toggleNavbar}>
	<slot />
</button>
{/key}
```

Here, we import the `scale` transition, and use it together with the [transition](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/transition) directive. When you refresh your browser, you can check it and verify that the transition is applied, making the buttons change smoothly:

<ArticleImage alt="Gif showing buttons with transitions applied" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/video/upload/q_49/v1697238716/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Recording_2023-10-13_at_18.11.05.gif" />

Notice that the transition makes each button scale up and down, making the appearance/hiding of them more noticeable to the user.

Notice also, in the code, that I've changed the position of the buttons to `absolute` so the replacement of one over the other, while the transition is executing, is perceivable.

Now, let's do the same with the navigation. In the `Menu.svelte` component file import a new transition called `fly`
and two easings called `sineIn` and `sineOut`. In the following code snippet, you'll see how we can define a new transition configuration using these tools.

```html
<script>
import { navIsOpen } from "./stores";
import MenuBtn from "./MenuBtn.svelte";
import CloseBtn from "./CloseBtn.svelte";
import { fly } from "svelte/transition";
import { sineIn, sineOut } from "svelte/easing";

</script>

  

<div class="ml-auto p-4 relative">
	<MenuBtn />
	<CloseBtn />
</div>

{#key $navIsOpen}

<nav in:fly={{ y: -200, easing: sineIn }}
     out:fly={{ y: -200, easing: sineOut }}
	 class:navIsOpen={$navIsOpen} class="w-full hidden py-8">

	<ul class="text-center text-2xl tracking-wider text-slate-200">
		<li><a href="/">About</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Products</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Reviews</a></li>
		<li><a href="/">Contact</a></li>
	</ul>
</nav>

{/key}

<style>
	.navIsOpen {
		@apply block;
	}

	nav li {
		@apply py-4 border-b border-b-violet-400;
	}
</style>
```

This line of code `in:fly={{ y: -200, easing: sineIn }}` means that we're using a `fly` transition with the [in](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/in-and-out) directive, that tells us it's going to be triggered when the component is revealed. The `nav` is positioned to a `y` coordinate of `-200px`, and an easing function `sineIn` is also applied. When the navigation is hidden, another `out` transition is applied with a similar configuration as the `in` one. 

Look at the following **.gif** image and see these transitions in action:

Of course, there are different [options](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/adding-parameters-to-transitions) to configure your Svelte transitions. You can change the [easing functions](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-easing), the [duration](https://svelte.dev/docs/element-directives#transition-parameters), and delay times, for example. You have many options to make your App interface look smoother while the user is interacting with it. I suggest you experiment with them, analyzing, for example, which easing function best matches your transition.

So, that's a wrap! Thank you for visiting this series of posts and I hope you have learned one thing or two. 
Remember that you can [visit the repository](https://github.com/franc014/blog-responsive-astro-svelte-navbar) for the example [demo](https://tailwind-svelte-navbar.vercel.app/) in this series to further analyze the code and the dynamics I've shown throughout the 4 parts.
