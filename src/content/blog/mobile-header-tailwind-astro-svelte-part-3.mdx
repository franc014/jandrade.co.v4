Welcome to the third part of this tutorial series. In this post, 
we'll continue enhancing our demo application, refactoring our state management to Svelte stores.

## Going from component state to store state

Currently, in our demo codebase, we have defined state at the component level in `Menu.svelte`. Our reactive state variable called `navIsOpen` is updated 
from the toggle button components `MenuBtn.svelte` and `CloseBtn.svelte` which use the `event dispatching` technique. 
We emit the custom event`openNavigation` and listen for it in the parent component `Menu.svelte` to update the `navIsOpen` state.

The following diagram shows this event flow:

But, as you may have already noticed, we're repeating a lot of code between the button components. 
Both have the same code in their "click" event handlers, dispatching the same custom event "openNavigation". 
I think we must refactor this flow now, and fortunately, Svelte has more options for us to work with the application state. 
Let's explore Svelte stores and see how well this will work for us.

## Creating our first store

Stores in Svelte allow us to define state at a central location where not only components but javascript modules can access it in order to use it in their different functionalities. The following diagram explains the new flow we're going to use in our application.

![Event flow using Svelte store](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1695155813/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230919153506.png)

In our application, we're going to transfer the component state `navIsOpen` defined in `Menu.svelte` to a store, 
so we can access it from the `MenuBtn.svelte` and `CloseBtn.svelte` components. This process is as follows: 

1. Create a new javascript file called `stores.js` in the Svelte components folder
2. Inside that file, import a writable store:
```javascript
	import { writable } from "svelte/store";
```

3. Create and export a store variable called `navIsOpen`, and assign it to the `writable()` function call. 
The argument `writable()` receives, is the initial state value.

```javascript
import { writable } from "svelte/store";
export const navIsOpen = writable(false);
```

This way we have created our first store. To use the variable `navIsOpen`, 
we need to import it into the components where we need it. Let's start with the `Menu.svelte` store:

1. Remove all the code related to the component state we defined previously. I've commented that code we don't need any further.

```javascript
<script>

import MenuBtn from "./MenuBtn.svelte";
import CloseBtn from "./CloseBtn.svelte";

/* let navIsOpen = false;
function toggleNavbar() {
navIsOpen = !navIsOpen;
} */

</script>
```

2. Import the `navIsOpen` store variable:

```javascript
<script>

import {navIsOpen} from './stores';

import MenuBtn from "./MenuBtn.svelte";

import CloseBtn from "./CloseBtn.svelte";
...
```

3. The `navIsOpen` is reactive, so any update we make to its value will affect all the places where we use it. 
Of course, one of those places in our application is the `nav` element in the `Menu.svelte` component, 
which is used to conditionally show or hide it, using the `class:navIsOpen` directive:

```html
<nav class:navIsOpen={$navIsOpen} class="w-full hidden py-8">
```

To use the store variable `navIsOpen`, it has to be preceded by the `$` character. Never forget this, 
because an important step of memory cleanup is involved when using this [auto-subscription](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/auto-subscriptions) construct.  

4. By the way, the CSS that defines if the navigation is hidden or not, keeps intact. We still use the class name `navIsOpen`

```css
<style>

.navIsOpen {
@apply block;
}

nav li {
@apply py-4 border-b border-b-violet-400;
}

</style>
```

So now, we have established a relationship between this component and the `navIsOpen` store variable. if you manually change the initial 
setup from `false` to `true` in `stores.js`, you'll see that the menu opens. 

Our next step is to update our store, via the menu and close buttons.

## Updating the store from MenuBtn and CloseBtn components

`navIsOpen` is a writable store and it means that its value can be updated. To prove this, we're going to change its value to `true` when we click the menu button and to `false` when we click the close button. In each of the components that abstract the buttons, let's write the following code on each `on:click` handler. Of course, remove the previous one related to event dispatchers, given that we have replaced that event flow. 

```javascript

<script>

import {navIsOpen} from './stores';

//import { createEventDispatcher } from "svelte";

//export let navIsOpen;

//const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();
function toggleNavbar(e) {

navIsOpen.update((open)=>!open );

//dispatch("openNavigation");

}

</script>
```

Again, just for illustration, I've commented the previous code. But now, I'm importing the store, and on this, I've called the `update()` method. 
As you can see, it receives a callback with the current value of the store variable. I've named it `open`. 
The logic inside this callback is to `toggle` the store variable between `true` and `false`. 

```javascript
navIsOpen.update((open)=>!open );
```

Also, in the `button` element, let's assign the store to the `class:isOpen` directive. 
Remember that `navIsOpen` is reactive and will cause the effect we want on each element we use it, 
for example, hiding or showing the button: 

```html
<button class:navIsOpen={$navIsOpen} class="block" on:click={toggleNavbar} />
```

The CSS block doesn't have to change at all, as we have already pointed out in the previous section. 

The same logic must be applied in the `CloseBtn` component. 

Test again and check that whereas we have changed our event flow architecture, we keep our application working, and the code refactor has successfully been accomplished. 

## A step further in code refactoring

Refactoring is an ongoing process and while we've already made some refactoring on our application using stores, there's still work to do. Indeed, if you take a look at the menu and close button components, you can clearly identify that except for notable differences in the SVG icon and the CSS to hide or show the button, they perform the same action of updating the state in the Svelte store. This is a clear opportunity for refactoring. 

Let's abstract the logic common to both buttons in one new component called `NavBtn.svelte`. In this new file:

1. Replace the SVG icon with a slot. This will be the space we'll fill with a different button icon, depending on which one will be inheriting. Also, remove the `class:navIsOpen` directive and the Tailwind class. We'll define the visibility of the button not on its `button` tag, but rather on the SVG we'll fill in the slot space. You'll check it in a minute.

```html
<button on:click={toggleNavbar}>

<slot />

</button>
```

2. Remove the `style` block from this component. Each button inheriting it will have its own CSS visibility rules, depending on the value of the store variable. 

Next, we'll refactor each button to use the `NavBtn.svelte` component as a "template", filling the `slot ` with the respective SVG icon and keeping the `style` block intact. Additionally, remember to define the classes needed to define the visibility of the button in the open tag of the SVG icon.
For example, the `MenuBtn.svelte` component will be refactored to this: 

```html
<script>
	import { navIsOpen } from "./stores";
	import NavBtn from "./NavBtn.svelte";
</script>

<NavBtn>
	<svg
	xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
	fill="none"
	viewBox="0 0 24 24"
	stroke-width="1.5"
	stroke="currentColor"
	class="w-10 h-10 text-slate-200 block"
	class:navIsOpen={$navIsOpen}
>	
		<path
		stroke-linecap="round"
		stroke-linejoin="round"
		d="M3.75 5.25h16.5m-16.5 4.5h16.5m-16.5 4.5h16.5m-16.5 4.5h16.5"
		/>
	</svg>
</NavBtn>

<style>

.navIsOpen {

@apply hidden;

}

```

Take a look at the `class:navIsOpen` directive and the Tailwind class list. The `block` class means this button will be visible when loading the app, and the class directive will be reactive to the state change of the store variable: `class:navIsOpen={$navIsOpen}`

For the close button, the inverse of this logic is applied. Please, [visit the branch](https://github.com/franc014/blog-responsive-astro-svelte-navbar/tree/refactor-to-stores) that corresponds to this refactoring to check all the code details.

This way, we've arrived at the end of our refactoring. But to enhance our application [demo](https://tailwind-svelte-navbar.vercel.app/), even further, in the next post we will add an important feature related to motion. Stay tuned!
