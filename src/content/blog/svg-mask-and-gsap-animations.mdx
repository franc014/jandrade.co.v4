Using masks, we can control the visibility of one or more elements.
Based on another shape, we can reveal or hide portions of an image or
graphic applying levels of transparency or alpha values.

As an example, I'm going to create a basic composition with two images
using a gradient mask. The following are the two photos that clearly
show details corresponding to different contexts:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Two different images,an ocean, and a dolphin, in different contexts, one over the other"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1692980686/jandrade.co.v4/sro3sg4cnhctwvyihk0a.png"
/>

Applying a radial gradient to the dolphin photo, and making it work as a mask, we can get the following result:

<ArticleImage
  alt="A result image that is the masking of the sea photo with the dolphin one, applying a gradient to it"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1692981150/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230807130625.png"
/>

The dark part of the gradient hides the details we want from the dolphin image and shows the parts necessary for the composition.

Depending on the art direction, we can use a shape, with a gradient background to reveal or hide elements, so we get the desired results.

## How to create masks in Boxy SVG

As with Clip Paths, we can create Mask works in any Vector Graphics tool like Illustrator or any tool you are comfortable with. The previous example was created using Boxy SVG and I'm going to show how you can work with it.

First, import the images you want. In this case, I'm going to import the sea and the dolphin. Next, over those images, we can create a rectangle or any other shape that will be used as a mask.
I used an ellipse shape, like so:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Creating an ellipse in Boxy SVG to use it as a masking shape for the photos"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1692981342/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-08-07_at_13.17.58.png"
/>

The ellipse in the previous image has a lower opacity so we can clearly see the dolphin.
But, what we really need is an opaque gradient that helps us to hide and reveal details
from the dolphin photograph as shown next:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Applying a gradient to the masking ellipse to reveal or hide details on the dolphin photo"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1692981643/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-08-07_at_13.21.48.png"
/>

I think that this is the most important piece of knowledge related to masks: The **BLACK** part of the radial gradient will **HIDE** the details we want from the dolphin photo, and the **WHITE** part of the radial gradient will **SHOW** the ones we want.
The following part of this short process is to actually **mask** the dolphin image with the ellipse. For this, first, we select the image and then the ellipse (shift + click), on the objects panel:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Selecting the images and the masking ellipse as a previous step to apply to mask the photos"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1692981871/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-08-07_at_13.28.08.png"
/>

Then, on the Compositing panel, click the **Mask** button:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Applying the mask to photos in the Boxy SVG editor"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1692982080/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230807133344.png"
/>

And the mask is ready, resulting in a nice visual composition.

# Understanding the SVG masks generated code

In the bottom elements panel. we can inspect the generated code produced by the masked dolphin,
and it must be something like the one exported to the following pen:

<Codepen pen="GRwLyrQ" />

Take a look at the `<defs>` group of elements. We have an `radialGradient` element that defines the gradient applied to the `ellipse` which corresponds to the masking shape and is inside an `<mask>` element, of course. The `<mask>` element has an `id` attribute (`mask-0`) that we will need to apply to the dolphin photo.
In fact, if we examine the images, the first one doesn't have a style attribute so the mask definitely is not applied to it. It corresponds to the sea background image. The second image does have a style attribute in which a property `mask: url(#mask-0)` has been set up.
We can move this property to the styles tab in Codepen and we would have this:

```css
#dolphin {
  mask: url(#mask-0);
}
```

If you want to try this option, don't forget to set an id for the dolphin photo, and remove the `style` attribute from it.

Now that we have understood the `mask` mechanism and its use with SVG elements, let's try a GSAP animation!

## Animating SVG masks with GSAP

Similar to SVG Clip Paths, animations that use SVG Masks can be accomplished with the use of libraries like GSAP. But it's better to show how this works with a new example in which we're going to animate the appearance of some graphics behind a mask.

### Importing the images

In any graphical tool you're comfortable with, import approximately five images, whatever you want them to be. In my case, I've imported 5 animal vectors from the images panel in Boxy SVG and placed them over a rectangle, like so:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Screenshot of animal vectors, for use in GSAP animation"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1691698924/jandrade.co.v4/Screen_Shot_2023-08-10_at_15.21.43.png"
/>

Be sure to group all the graphics and name your grouping, so you can refer to them later. I entered an `id` for this grouping, located in the Meta panel:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Screenshot showing how to define an id for the group of images for the animation"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1691699332/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230810152752.png"
/>

## Creating the mask

I created another rectangle of the same dimensions as the background. This rectangle has a gradient, as you can see next:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Screenshot of a gradient that will be the mask of animal graphics"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1691699635/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230810153334.png"
/>

You may have noticed that there's an **"Edit Tool"** option in the **Fill** panel of the shape. When you use this tool, there's a gradient configurator that allows you to define stops for the gradient colors. In the example, there are 3 stops to get the result we need to mask the images below (animals), showing all of them but the end of the rectangle that contains them (background).
Maybe, you will not notice it clearly by now, but later when we start animating, we'll understand the utility of this gradient mask.

### Masking the animal graphics

To mask the images, I first selected the "animals" group and then the mask gradient in the Objects panel.

<ArticleImage
  alt="Screen shot of animals and mask selection"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1691700525/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230810154700.png"
/>

Next, I clicked the **Mask** option in the compositing panel:

<ArticleImage
  alt="Screenshot of masking the images with the gradient"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpkdo5tf/image/upload/v1691700659/jandrade.co.v4/Pasted_image_20230810154800.png"
/>

That's all our work in the graphical editing tool. Now, let's copy the generated SVG elements and export them to a pen, where we're going to create code for the GSAP animation.

### Animating the masking gradient rectangle

I've created [this pen](https://codepen.io/franc014/pen/OJaYORN), already loaded with the GSAP library
and its dev tools plugin. You can also see that I've also created the first part of the animation
that moves the masking gradient rectangle from left to right, creating the effect of revealing the
images masked by the gradient. Remember that this gradient has a black stop at the right extreme and, as it's a mask,
based on how this should work, it will hide the part of the image or shape it's over, and the white section of it,
will reveal the shape or image, like so:

<Codepen pen="OJaYORN" />

Take a close look at how the images appear one by one while the mask is moving from a starting point of `xPercentage: -100` (left to right).
There's a sort of shadow that creates the effect of each image appearing from behind. But, maybe we can improve it a little further by making each image move while they show, so let's add the following tween and see a subtle difference that improves the animation.

```javascript
.from('#animals > g',{
  duration: 2,
  x: 500
},'<')
```

### Enhancing the animation by grouping the masked images

Another way to animate the previous example, including the effect of the images moving while revealing, is to group the group of images and masking that external group. The following pen shows this variant implementation:

<Codepen pen="ExOBKdw" />

Observe that the tween is only applied to the group of images, and not the mask, making it more simple than the previous version in which we used a couple of tweens to get to the desired result.

## Conclusion

Of course, we have just touched the basics of SVG Masks. You may want to review the MDN documentation to learn more about it.
The following are other examples that use masks for text, dashed paths, and one with a combination of clipping paths.
